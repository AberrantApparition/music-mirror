# Valid log levels: error, warn, info, debug, trace. Debug and trace print logs for every track processed. Info only prints summaries at the end of each step. Warn only logs on issues. Any error log will terminate the script

# The opus bitrate to transcode at, in Kbps

# Whether to allow modifications to the source music library

# Whether to use the SHA224 hash of a file as its fingerprint, as opposed to the file modification time. The hash takes longer to compute (modification time is basically instant to grab), but eliminates false positives

# The method to mirror non-transcoded files by:
# copy:      make a copy of the file
# soft_link: create a soft link / symbolic link to the original file. This saves space since files are not copied. On Windows this may require running as admin
# hard_link: create a hard link to the original file. Similar to a soft link but the source and mirrored music libraries must reside on the same filesystem

# Whether to print the full paths to library files in logs (e.g. song.flac vs library/song.flac)
log_full_paths: True
# Whether to ignore hidden files. The implementation here considers a non-hidden file inside a hidden directory to be hidden
ignore_hidden: True
# Whether to check for and fix flac padding. If enabled, the script will move all padding blocks to the end of the metadata and merge them. It will resize padding if it is too large or small
check_padding: True
# The minimum amount of padding to accept in flacs, in bytes. Recommended to keep lower than max_padding_size, to stop spurious rewrites of padding if metadata changes reduce available padding

# The maximum amount of padding to accept in flacs, in bytes. Also used to set the amount of padding when re-encoding flacs
